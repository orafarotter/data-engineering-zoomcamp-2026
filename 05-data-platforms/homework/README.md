# Module 5 Homework: Data Platforms with Bruin

## Question 1. Bruin Pipeline Structure

In a Bruin project, what are the required files/directories?

- A: `.bruin.yml` and `pipeline/` with `pipeline.yml` and `assets/`

## Question 2. Materialization Strategies

You're building a pipeline that processes NYC taxi data organized by month based on `pickup_datetime`. Which materialization strategy should you use for the staging layer that deduplicates and cleans the data?

- A: `time_interval` - incremental based on a time column

## Question 3. Pipeline Variables

You have the following variable defined in `pipeline.yml`:

```yaml
variables:
  taxi_types:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    default: ["yellow", "green"]
```

How do you override this when running the pipeline to only process yellow taxis?

- A: `bruin run --var 'taxi_types=["yellow"]'`

## Question 4. Running with Dependencies

You've modified the `ingestion/trips.py` asset and want to run it plus all downstream assets. Which command should you use?

- A: `bruin run ingestion/trips.py --downstream`

## Question 5. Quality Checks

You want to ensure the `pickup_datetime` column in your trips table never has NULL values. Which quality check should you add to your asset definition?

- A: `name: not_null`

## Question 6. Lineage and Dependencies

After building your pipeline, you want to visualize the dependency graph between assets. Which Bruin command should you use?

- A: `bruin lineage`

## Question 7. First-Time Run

You're running a Bruin pipeline for the first time on a new DuckDB database. What flag should you use to ensure tables are created from scratch?

- A: `--full-refresh`
